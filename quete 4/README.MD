- iterativefactorial.go

Write an iterative function that returns the factorial of the int passed as parameter.
Errors (non possible values or overflows) will return 0.

- recursivefactorial.go 

Write a recursive function that returns the factorial of the int passed as parameter.
Errors (non possible values or overflows) will return 0.
for is forbidden for this exercise.

- iterativepower.go

Write an iterative function that returns the value of nb to the power of power.
Negative powers will return 0. Overflows do not have to be dealt with.

- recursivepower.go

Write a recursive function that returns the value of nb to the power of power.
Negative powers will return 0. Overflows do not have to be dealt with.
for is forbidden for this exercise.

- sqrt.go

Write a function that returns the square root of the int passed as parameter, if that square root is a whole number. Otherwise it returns 0.

- isprime.go

Write a function that returns true if the int passed as parameter is a prime number. Otherwise it returns false.
The function must be optimized in order to avoid time-outs with the tester.
(We consider that only positive numbers can be prime numbers)
(We also consider that 1 is not a prime number)
